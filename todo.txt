- Should the redirect in /auth be to the login page or the client provided uri
  - where does the login page come into it and if it is currently correct, how do you get the auth code passed in ???
- need to work on the mock page
- Most of the variables need to be read in via config.yaml to make everything a bit cleaner
  - This probably includes the mocked database or some realistic form of DCR

- add tls back after everything works
- Review readme references and rebuild the bases of the handlers and fields
- Turn Access Token into a JWT
- Look into why the redirect page is needed? whose page is it... use the template
- Add a third service that has resources and uses the auth server to grant access
- create variables for service addresses
- consider moving towards a docker setup??

After auth flow is complete all code bases need a huge clean and some documentation before moving on to the next flow
