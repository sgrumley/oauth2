- Look at making the client use more like a library. AuthClient should be out of package and have a NewClient()
- Turn TLS on and get working
- Review RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.2
  - Clean up the code and make references back to spec
- Add Client Registration
  - make use of client secret
- Turn Access Token into a JWT
- Decide on naming. Login/mock/frontend. authcode/authcodeclient. server/

-> Once above complete move on to next flow
- Add MTLS
- PKCE
- OIDC
